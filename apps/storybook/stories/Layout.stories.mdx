# Layout

---

---

Given that Spirokit was built on top of [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/), we are inheriting all the layout components from it, so you don't need to add Native Base to your project.
Besides, Spirokit adds a few customizations on top such as:
- Shorthand props like `p`, `m`, `w`, `h` where removed in favor of a more easy to read code.
- Color props like `backgroundColor` and `color` will list all the colors included in spirokit.
- Typography props like `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing`, `fontWeight`, and `fontSize` will also list Spirokit tokens only.

Here`s a list of all the available components:

## Box

Flexible and generic component similar to a `div`or a `View`component. [More info](https://docs.nativebase.io/box#h2-props)

## HStack

Allows you to align items horizontally. [More info](https://docs.nativebase.io/hstack#h2-props)

## VStack

Allows you to align items vertically. [More info](https://docs.nativebase.io/vstack#h2-props)

## ZStack

Allows you to stack elements on top of each other. [More info](https://docs.nativebase.io/zstack#h2-props)

## Flex

Essentially a `Box` component with `display: flex`. [More info](https://docs.nativebase.io/flex#h2-props)

## AspectRatio

`Box`component that allows you to define the desired height or width, and choose the aspect ratio. The component will calculate the missing dimension for you. [More info](https://docs.nativebase.io/aspect-ratio#h2-props)

## Center

`Box`component that automatically centers the content both vertically and horizontally. [More info](https://docs.nativebase.io/center#h2-props)

## Container

The Container restricts a content's width according to current breakpoint, while keeping the size fluid. [More info](https://docs.nativebase.io/container#h2-props)
